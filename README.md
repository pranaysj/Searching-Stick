# 🔍 Search Algorithm Visualizer (SFML)

Welcome to **Search Algorithm Visualizer**, a dynamic C++ project powered by **SFML** that brings search algorithms to life with stunning real-time visuals! 🖥️🎨

## 🚀 Project Overview

This visualizer explores two fundamental search techniques:

### 🔴 Linear Search
- Scans an array of "sticks" (visual elements) one-by-one.
- Highlights each element in red as it checks.
- Ideal for small or unsorted datasets.
- A great way to understand brute-force search visually.

### ⚡ Binary Search
- Operates on sorted data.
- Divides the search space in half each step.
- Much faster and more efficient.
- Visual cues make it easy to grasp the divide-and-conquer approach.

## 🎨 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Graphics Library:** [SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
- Real-time rendering and smooth animations
